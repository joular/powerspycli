PowerSpyCli
===========

PowerSpyCli is a tool to connect and collect power metrics from a [PowerSpy 2 powermeter](https://www.alciom.com/nos-metiers/produits/powerspy2/).

PowerSpyCli is tested on GNU/Linux and works with Python 3.

## Installation

To run PowerSpyCli, you need to install ```bluez``` and ```python-bluez```.

On Debian/Ubuntu: ```apt install bluez python-bluez```. On Arch-based distros: install ```bluez``` and ```python-pybluez```.

Then clone the repo (or just download the ```powerspycli.py``` file), and run it.

### Installing on SailfishOS

On the Linux-based mobile OS, SailfishOS, you can run PowerSpyCli by installing the following packages:
```
devel-su zypper install bluez5-libs-devel make gcc glib2-devel
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install wheel
pip install pybluez
```

## Running PowerSpyCli

To run PowerSpyCli and start collecting power metrics, just run the python file: ```python powerspycli.py``` or directly ```./powerspycli.py```.

The tool requires the bluetooth device address of the PowerSpy in order to run: ```./powerspycli.py 00:11:22:33:44:55```.

### Arguments

PowerSpyCli, by default, will display the power consumption of the PowerSpy every second.
To show all the collected metrics (i.e., voltage, ampere, etc.), run it with the ```-a``` argument.

The ```-v``` argument will display all the logs and connection info (verbose mode).

To save the power data along with the timestamp to a CSV file, use the ```-f``` argument:
```./powerspycli.py 00:11:22:33:44:55 -f file.csv```.

PowerSpyCli is a multi-platform tool to connect and collect power metrics from a [PowerSpy 2 powermeter](https://www.alciom.com/nos-metiers/produits/powerspy2/).

PowerSpyCli works in Windows, Linux and macOS with Python 3.

## Installation

Just download the ```powerspycli.py``` file and run it.

## Running PowerSpyCli

To run PowerSpyCli and start collecting power metrics, just run the python file: ```python powerspycli.py``` or directly ```./powerspycli.py```.

The tool requires the PowerSpy2 MAC address in order to run: ```./powerspycli.py 00:11:22:33:44:55```.

### Arguments

PowerSpyCli, by default, will display the power consumption of the PowerSpy every second.
To show all the collected metrics (i.e., voltage, ampere, etc.), run it with the ```-a``` argument.

The ```-v``` argument will display all the logs and connection info (verbose mode).

To save the power data along with the timestamp to a CSV file, use the ```-f``` argument:
```./powerspycli.py 00:11:22:33:44:55 -f file.csv```.
